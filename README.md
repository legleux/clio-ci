## Clio packages
The Clio repository contains only the source code and unit tests for the Clio server. The packaging code is contained in the [clio-packages](https://github.com/XRPLF/clio-packages.git).
The XRPLF organization has access to Ripple provided self-hosted GitHub runners with much better specs that what GitHub provides for free.

When a push or pull-request is made to the Clio repo, the Action for building the project checks out the `clio-packages` repo in a directory next to the Clio source. The `clio-packages` project builds Clio using CMake's [ExternalProject](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/module/ExternalProject.html) by copying the source passed in via a `CLIO_ROOT` environment variable or defined by the configure (`-DCLIO_ROOT=<clio_src_dir>`). The `clio-packages repo` uses the `PATCH_COMMAND` step of CMakeâ€™s ExternalProject to overlay the packaging CMake code into the repository as if it were one repo.

The current pipeline lints the Clio source with clang-format, builds the `clio_server`, `clio_tests` and clio packages then runs the `clio_tests` executable. The `clio_server` executable is provided by a `clio_server` package while the `clio` package provides `clio_server` with a [`rippled`](https://github.com/XRPLF/ripple.git) configured to work with the server.
Packages are are currently only available as apt packages for Debian based systems.

The build is performed using GCC-11 on Ubuntu 20.04 requiring the [clio dependencies](https://github.com/XRPLF/clio#building) and `equivs-build` for the `rippled`/`clio_server` virtual package.

Packages can be installed by adding Ripple's gpg key and deb repo and updating apt's sources

    $ sudo apt-get install -y wget gpg

    $ sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/keyrings/
    $ wget -q -O - "https://repos.ripple.com/repos/api/gpg/key/public" | gpg --dearmor > ripple-key.gpg
    $ sudo mv ripple-key.gpg /usr/local/share/keyrings
    $ echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/local/share/keyrings/ripple-key.gpg] https://repos.ripple.com/repos/rippled-deb focal stable" | \
        sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ripple.list

    $ sudo apt update && apt search clio
